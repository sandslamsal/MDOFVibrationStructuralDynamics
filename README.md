# Multi-Story-Building-Vibration-Analysis-in-MATLAB
Description:
This MATLAB script performs a comprehensive vibration analysis of a multi-story building. Key features and functionalities include:

Defining Building Properties: Users can specify the number of stories, along with each floor's mass, height, and moment of inertia.
Stiffness and Mass Matrix Calculation: The script calculates the stiffness and mass matrices for the building, considering the physical properties of each floor.
Natural Frequency and Mode Shape Analysis: Eigenvalue problem solving is used to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the building.
Mode Shape Normalization and Visualization: Both normalized and non-normalized mode shapes are calculated and plotted for clear visualization.
Time History Response Analysis: The script performs a time history analysis for free vibration response under initial conditions.
Free Vibration Response Visualization: It plots the free vibration response of each floor, offering insights into how each part of the building reacts over time.

Usage and Customization:
Users can easily modify the number of stories and their respective properties.
Suitable for educational purposes, structural engineering analysis, and as a base for more complex simulations.

Technical Details:
Language: MATLAB.
Key Concepts Demonstrated: Stiffness matrix assembly, eigenvalue problems, mode shape normalization, time history analysis.
